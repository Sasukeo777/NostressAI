## The Problem: Admin Overload

Knowledge workers spend **up to 60%** of their time on "work about work" — scheduling, status updates, email triage, formatting documents. This is exactly the kind of repetitive, rule-based work that AI assistants excel at.

---

## Three Levels of AI Delegation

### Level 1: Reactive Assistance
- Ask ChatGPT/Claude to draft emails, summarize documents, or reformat data.
- **Time saved**: 10-30 minutes per task.

### Level 2: Proactive Workflows
- Create reusable **prompt templates** for recurring tasks (weekly summaries, meeting prep).
- Use tools like Zapier + OpenAI to automate triggers.
- **Time saved**: 2-5 hours per week.

### Level 3: Autonomous Agents
- Deploy AI agents that handle end-to-end workflows (inbox triage, calendar optimization, research synthesis).
- Requires clear **governance principles**: what decisions can the agent make vs. escalate?
- **Time saved**: 10+ hours per week (once configured).

## Building Your AI Support System

1. **Audit Your Week**: Track where you spend time on low-judgment tasks.
2. **Create a Prompt Library**: Start with 3-5 templates for your most common tasks.
3. **Set Boundaries**: Define what the AI can decide vs. what requires your input.

---

## Example: Email Triage Prompt

```
You are my email assistant. For each email:
1. Categorize: [Action Required] [FYI] [Delegate] [Archive]
2. Draft a response if action is required.
3. Flag anything that needs my personal attention.
```

## Caution: Intentional AI Use

AI support is most effective when it **reduces** cognitive load, not adds to it. Avoid:
- Constantly context-switching to chat with AI.
- Over-automating creative or relationship-building work.
- Ignoring governance (especially with sensitive data).

The goal is **calm delegation**, not more noise.

## Why Breathing Works

Your breath is the **only autonomic function** you can consciously control. Slow, extended exhales activate the parasympathetic nervous system (rest-and-digest), pulling you out of fight-or-flight mode in minutes.

## The 5-Minute Protocol

### Setup (30 seconds)
1. Find a quiet spot. Sit or stand comfortably.
2. Close your eyes or soften your gaze.
3. Place one hand on your chest, one on your belly.

### Box Breathing (2 minutes)
Inhale for 4 counts → Hold for 4 counts → Exhale for 4 counts → Hold for 4 counts.

Repeat 4-6 cycles. Focus on making your exhale smooth and complete.

### Extended Exhale (2 minutes)
Inhale for 4 counts → Exhale for 6-8 counts.

This shifts the balance further toward calm. Repeat 4-6 cycles.

### Integration (30 seconds)
Return to natural breathing. Notice any shifts in your body — jaw, shoulders, chest. Take one final deep breath before opening your eyes.

## When to Use This

- **Before a difficult meeting**: Calm your nervous system so you can think clearly.
- **After a stressful email**: Reset before reacting.
- **Mid-afternoon slump**: Oxygenate instead of reaching for caffeine.
- **Before sleep**: Wind down the HPA axis for better rest.

## Bonus: Physiological Sigh

For an even faster reset (30 seconds):
1. Inhale deeply through your nose.
2. At the top, take a second quick inhale to fully inflate your lungs.
3. Exhale slowly through your mouth.

This technique has been shown to rapidly reduce cortisol.
